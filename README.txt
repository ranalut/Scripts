These are scripts generated for the Pacific Northwest Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment project.  Scripts fall into two categories:

1. Processing of Spatial Data layers for use in the HexSim modeling environment
2. Execution and manipulation of outputs from HexSim models

All data files used in this project are kept on local discs.

Note: I created this folder from my previous folder of scripts by keeping only the newest versions of all files.  Previous version are in the Old Scripts/ folder and were generated without a version control system.
